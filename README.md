Solution of the Problem 7 Section 6.4 from the book Numerical Analysis: Mathematics of Scientific Computation

Draw a script letter. Then reproduce it with the aid of cubic splines and a plotter. Proceed as follows: Select a modest number of points on the curve, say n = 11. Label these t = 1, 2 , . . . , n. For each point, obtain the corresponding x- and y-coordinates. Then fit x = S x (t) and y = S y (t), using cubic spline interpolating functions S x and S y . This will produce a parametric representation of the original curve. Compute a large number of values of S x (t) and S y (t) to give to the plotter
